BakeStock is a Python command line interface (CLI) application designed to be used by small batch bakeries or 'micro-bakeries'. The application will allow the user to keep track of daily bakes and sales, calculate the next days bake batch numbers and keep track of ingredient inventory levels, alerting the user to any low ingredient levels.
